<b>Image processing basics</b>
<br>Image processing is an essential component of computer vision and involves manipulating digital images to enhance their quality, extract information, or perform some analysis.
</summary>

## Image representation and formats:
Digital images can be represented in various formats, such as grayscale, RGB, and HSV. Grayscale images have a single channel representing the intensity of light, while RGB images have three channels (red, green, and blue) that combine to create a wide range of colors. HSV (hue, saturation, value) is another color space that separates color information (hue) from the intensity (value) and saturation, making it easier to work with in some applications.

## Image filtering:
Image filters are used to perform various operations, such as smoothing, sharpening, or removing noise. Common filters include:

- Gaussian filter: A low-pass filter that smooths the image by blurring it with a Gaussian function. It helps reduce noise and smoothen out textures.
- Median filter: A non-linear filter that replaces each pixel's value with the median value of the neighboring pixels. It's particularly effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges.
- Laplacian filter: A second-order derivative filter that highlights regions with rapid intensity changes, often used for edge detection or image sharpening.

## Edge detection:
Edges are significant local changes in pixel intensity and represent object boundaries. Common edge detection techniques include:

- Canny edge detector: A multi-stage edge detection algorithm that involves smoothing, calculating gradients, non-maximum suppression, and thresholding with hysteresis. It produces thin, well-connected edges.
- Sobel operator: A pair of 3x3 convolution kernels that approximate the gradient of the image intensity in the horizontal and vertical directions. The magnitude of the gradient helps identify the edges.
- Prewitt operator: Similar to the Sobel operator, but with slightly different convolution kernels.

## Image transformation:
Image transformations involve changing the spatial arrangement of pixels in an image. Common transformations include:

- Scaling: Changing the size of the image by increasing or decreasing the number of pixels. Interpolation techniques like nearest-neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic are used to estimate the values of new pixels.
- Rotation: Rotating the image around a specified point by a given angle. This operation requires resampling the image and can cause aliasing artifacts.
- Translation: Shifting the image by a certain amount in the x and y directions. This operation can be used for tasks like image alignment or registration.

<br>These techniques are used to identify and describe distinctive points or regions in images, which can be used for tasks like object recognition, image matching, and tracking.
</summary>

## Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG):
HOG is a feature descriptor that captures the distribution of local intensity gradients in an image. It divides the image into small cells, computes the gradient histogram for each cell, and normalizes the histograms using overlapping blocks. HOG features are robust to changes in illumination and pose. They are widely used for object detection, particularly for human detection.

</summary>

## Thresholding:
Thresholding is a simple segmentation method that converts an image into a binary image by setting a global or local threshold.

<b>Optical flow and motion analysis</b>
<br>Optical flow is the apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a scene caused by the relative motion between the observer and the scene. Motion analysis techniques estimate the optical flow to understand the movement of objects in a sequence of images or video frames.
</summary>

## Differential methods:
Differential methods for optical flow estimation are based on the assumption that the intensity of a moving object remains constant over time. The most well-known differential method is the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, which uses a local linear approximation of the intensity and assumes that the flow is constant in a small neighborhood around each pixel. Another popular differential method is the Horn-Schunck algorithm, which enforces global smoothness constraints on the flow field.

### Advantages:
- Can provide dense flow fields
- Suitable for small, incremental motion

### Limitations:
- Sensitive to noise
- Can be affected by the aperture problem (ambiguous flow for one-dimensional structures)

These methods are trained on large datasets with ground truth depth maps and can learn to predict depth for complex, natural scenes. Popular deep learning-based methods include Monodepth, DepthNet, and DeMoN.

### Advantages:
- Can estimate depth from a single image (monocular depth estimation)
- Can handle complex scenes and textureless surfaces

### Limitations:
- Require large labeled datasets for training
- May not generalize well to unseen environments or conditions

When selecting a 3D reconstruction or depth estimation technique, consider factors such as the type of input data, the desired depth map density, the complexity of the scene, and the accuracy

<b>Camera calibration and intrinsic parameters</b>
<br>Camera calibration is the process of estimating the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Intrinsic parameters are properties of the camera itself, such as focal length, principal point, and lens distortion coefficients, while extrinsic parameters describe the camera's position and orientation in the world.
</summary>

## Lens distortion:
Real-world cameras exhibit various types of lens distortion, such as radial and tangential distortion, which cause straight lines in the world to appear curved in the image. Radial distortion is characterized by a center of distortion and distortion coefficients, while tangential distortion is caused by the lens not being perfectly parallel to the image plane.

## Calibration methods:
Camera calibration methods estimate the intrinsic parameters by observing a calibration object with known geometry (e.g., a checkerboard pattern) in multiple images. Popular calibration methods include:
- Direct Linear Transformation (DLT): A linear algebraic method that estimates the camera matrix by solving a system of linear equations obtained from the correspondences between world and image coordinates.
- Zhang's method: A flexible method that uses multiple images of a planar pattern in various orientations to estimate the camera's intrinsic parameters and radial distortion coefficients.

## Camera calibration in OpenCV:
OpenCV is a popular open-source computer vision library that provides functions for camera calibration, including finding the checkerboard corners, estimating the camera matrix and distortion coefficients, and correcting the lens distortion in images.

When calibrating a camera, consider factors such as the type of camera (e.g., pinhole, fisheye), the type and degree of lens distortion, the desired accuracy and precision of the calibration, and the computational efficiency of the calibration method.

<b>Evaluation metrics for computer vision tasks</b>
<br>Selecting appropriate evaluation metrics is crucial for assessing the performance of computer vision models and comparing them with other methods.
</summary>

## Classification:
- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances. Accuracy is a straightforward metric but may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets.
- Precision: The proportion of true positive instances among all instances predicted as positive. Precision is also known as positive predictive value (PPV).
- Recall: The proportion of true positive instances among all actual positive instances. Recall is also known as sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR).
- F1 score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced measure of both metrics. F1 score is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
- AUC-ROC: Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve measures the performance of a binary classifier across different classification thresholds. It quantifies the trade-off between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR).

## Object detection:
- Intersection over Union (IoU): A measure of the overlap between two bounding boxes, calculated as the area of their intersection divided by the area of their union.
- Average Precision (AP): The average of precision values at different recall levels. AP is often used to evaluate object detection models, with IoU thresholds commonly set at 0.5 or higher.
- Mean Average Precision (mAP): The mean of average precision values across multiple object classes. mAP is a widely used metric for object detection tasks, providing a single performance measure that balances precision and recall.

## Semantic segmentation:
- Pixel accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified pixels out of the total number of pixels. Pixel accuracy is a simple metric but may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets or cases where some classes are more important than others.
- Intersection over Union (IoU) for segmentation: Also known as the Jaccard index, it measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth segmentation.
- Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU): The mean of the IoU values across multiple object classes. mIoU is a commonly used metric for semantic segmentation tasks, providing a single performance measure that considers the quality of the segmentation.
- Dice coefficient: The harmonic mean of precision and recall for segmentation tasks, calculated as 2 times the area of intersection between the predicted and ground truth segmentations divided by the sum of their areas.

Selecting appropriate evaluation metrics depends on the specific computer vision task, the nature of the dataset, and the desired trade-offs between different aspects of the model's performance. In many cases, it is helpful to report multiple evaluation metrics to provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance.
