<summary>What Is Grand Central Dispatch?</summary>

Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is a powerful technology that enables iOS developers to write multithreaded code easily and efficiently. In essence, GCD is a queue-based system that manages the execution of tasks on multicore hardware. By breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable units of work and executing them concurrently, GCD can take full advantage of the power of modern processors, making your app run faster and smoother.

GCD is a technology that operates at the system level, making it easier for your app to execute tasks on multicore hardware. By leveraging GCD, your app can schedule work for execution through an easy-to-use API, leaving it to GCD to decide when and how the scheduled work is executed.

At the core of GCD are dispatch queues, which are queues onto which work can be scheduled for execution. GCD provides several options for scheduling work onto a dispatch queue, including submitting a block or a closure that takes no arguments and returns void or an empty tuple. Here's an example:

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    print("Hello World")
}
```

In this example, we're submitting a closure to the main dispatch queue, which is associated with the main thread of the application. Work submitted to the main dispatch queue is guaranteed to be executed on the main thread, which is important for updating the user interface.

GCD also manages a pool or collection of threads, making it easier to perform work in the background without having to worry about creating and managing threads. GCD decides which thread is used to execute a block, which is an implementation detail that the developer doesn't need to worry about.

In addition to dispatch queues, GCD provides several other convenient APIs, including dispatch groups and semaphores, to manage complexity and avoid threading issues. GCD also offers Quality of Service classes to inform the system about the importance of the tasks your app is performing.

It's important to understand why it's beneficial for your app to take advantage of GCD. Modern computing devices have a complex architecture, and they are incredibly performant. However, as developers, we need to be careful how the resources of these devices are used. By leveraging GCD, your app can be a good citizen on the platform it runs on, by efficiently using resources and responding to changes in device capabilities.
