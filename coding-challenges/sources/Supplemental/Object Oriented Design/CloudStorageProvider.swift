 # Design Patterns for Cloud Storage in iOS

 When building a cloud storage app for iOS, there are several design patterns that can be used to improve the flexibility, modularity, and scalability of the app. In this post, we'll explore some of the key design patterns that can be used to build a robust and reliable cloud storage app for iOS.

 # Protocol-Oriented Programming
 Protocol-oriented programming (POP) is a design pattern that emphasizes the use of protocols to define interfaces between objects, rather than relying on class inheritance. In iOS development, POP is a popular pattern because it allows for greater code reuse and modularity, and can simplify the process of testing and debugging.

 In the cloud storage app we are building, we use POP to define the `CloudStorageServiceProtocol`, which defines the methods that must be implemented by any cloud storage service. By using a protocol, we can create different implementations of the `CloudStorageService` class, each of which conforms to the `CloudStorageServiceProtocol` interface. This makes it easy to switch between different cloud storage services, or to add support for new services in the future.

# Dependency Injection
 Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern that involves passing object dependencies as arguments to the constructor of a class, rather than creating the dependencies within the class itself. DI is a popular pattern because it makes code more modular and easier to test, since dependencies can be easily replaced with mock objects or stubs.

 In the cloud storage app, we use DI to inject the `CloudStorageServiceProtocol` into the `FolderManager` class, which provides a high-level interface for managing folders and files. By injecting the `CloudStorageServiceProtocol` into the `FolderManager` class, we can easily switch between different implementations of the cloud storage service, or even replace the service with a mock object for testing purposes.

# Factory Method
 The factory method is a design pattern that involves creating objects through a factory method, rather than creating them directly using the constructor. The factory method can be used to create different types of objects, or to create objects in different ways, depending on the needs of the application.

 In the cloud storage app, we use a factory method to create instances of the `FolderManager` class. The `CloudStorageService` class provides a factory method that creates a new instance of the `FolderManager` class, using the current instance of the `CloudStorageService` as the injected dependency. This makes it easy to create new instances of the `FolderManager` class as needed, while still maintaining a modular and decoupled architecture.

# Facade Pattern
 The facade pattern is a design pattern that involves creating a simplified interface to a complex system. In the cloud storage app, we can use the facade pattern to create a simplified interface to the `FolderManager` class, which itself provides a simplified interface to the underlying `CloudStorageServiceProtocol` implementation. By creating a facade for the `FolderManager` class, we can make it even easier to use and maintain, by hiding the complexity of the underlying system from the user.

 # Adapter Pattern
 The adapter pattern is a design pattern that involves adapting one interface to another, in order to allow two incompatible systems to work together. In the cloud storage app, we can use the adapter pattern to adapt different implementations of the `CloudStorageServiceProtocol` interface to work with the `FolderManager` class. For example, if we want to add support for a new cloud storage service that does not conform to the `CloudStorageServiceProtocol` interface, we can create an adapter that adapts the new service's interface to the `CloudStorageServiceProtocol` interface, allowing it to work with the existing `FolderManager` class.

 # Strategy Pattern
 The strategy pattern is a design pattern that involves defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. In the cloud storage app, we can use the strategy pattern to define different algorithms for uploading and downloading files, and to make them interchangeable based on the
